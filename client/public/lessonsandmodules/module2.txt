## Module 2: Water Conservation & Management

## Section 1: The Water Cycle and Pollution Sources

- **Lesson Content:**
    
    The water cycle describes how water moves through evaporation (from oceans, lakes), condensation (clouds), and precipitation (rain, snow). Pollution can enter water from factories, farms (chemical runoff), and untreated sewage, making clean water scarce.
    
- **Fun Fact:**
    
    Only about 1% of Earth's water is accessible for human use!

## Section 2: Conservation Techniques at Home and School

- **Lesson Content:**
    
    Simple conservation habits include fixing leaks, turning off the tap while brushing teeth, using buckets for washing, and watering plants in the early morning. Schools can install rainwater harvesting systems, reuse water for gardens, and educate students on saving water.
    
- **Example:**
    
    A running tap can waste nearly 6 liters of water per minute!

## Section 3: Ocean Protection Strategies

- **Lesson Content:**
    
    Oceans are essential for life. Reducing plastic waste, supporting clean-ups, and using fewer chemicals protect ocean life. Healthy oceans give us food, regulate climate, and produce oxygen.
    
- **Tip:**
    
    Always use reusable bags and bottles—never litter near waterways!

## Section 4: Understanding Water Usage

- **Lesson Content:**
    
    Water is used in farming, industries, and homes. Understanding where water is used most helps us make better choices. Reducing water waste saves energy and money, too.
    
- **Example:**
    
    Producing one cotton shirt uses over 2,700 liters of water!
