## Module 1: Climate Change Fundamentals

## Section 1: What Are Greenhouse Gases?

- **Lesson Content:**
    
    Greenhouse gases are invisible particles in our atmosphere like carbon dioxide (CO₂), methane (CH₄), and nitrous oxide (N₂O) that trap heat from the sun. This is natural—but human activities, like burning fossil fuels, have increased their levels.
    
- **Fun Fact:**
    
    CO₂ from car exhaust and methane from livestock add up to most of the greenhouse gas emissions!

## Section 2: Causes and Effects of Global Warming

- **Lesson Content:**
    
    Global warming happens when more greenhouse gases trap extra heat. Main causes: burning coal, oil, and gas; deforestation; factory emissions; and even agriculture.
    
    Effects include rising sea levels, melting glaciers, and more extreme weather.
    
- **Example:**
    
    Earth’s average temperature has already increased by more than 1°C since 1880!

## Section 3: Climate vs. Weather

- **Lesson Content:**
    
    Weather changes day-to-day—rain, sun, storms—while climate is the average weather pattern over decades.
    
    Example: Today’s rain is weather. A region having rainy winters for 50 years is climate.
    
- **Fun Fact:**
    
    Climate tells you what clothes to pack for a trip; weather tells you what to wear today!

## Section 4: Real-Life Data—How Scientists Study Change

- **Lesson Content:**
    
    Scientists use satellites, weather stations, and ocean buoys to collect data. They compare temperature, rainfall, and ice levels over time to predict changes and advise action.
    
- **Example:**
    
    NASA studies Arctic ice loss with satellites every year!

## Section 5: Simple Actions to Help

- **Lesson Content:**
    - Use less energy: turn off lights, unplug devices
    - Plant trees: absorb CO₂
    - Reduce, reuse, recycle: less landfill
    - Eat local food
        
        Every student’s effort adds up—small actions can help slow climate change!
