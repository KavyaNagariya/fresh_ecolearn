## Module 3: Renewable Energy Systems

## Section 1: Solar, Wind, and Hydroelectric Power

- **Lesson Content:**
    
    Renewable energy comes from sources that won’t run out—like sunlight, wind, and water. Solar panels turn sunlight into electricity. Wind turbines use wind to generate power. Hydroelectric dams use flowing water to spin turbines and create energy.
    
- **Fun Fact:**
    
    The world’s largest solar farm can power hundreds of thousands of homes!

## Section 2: Energy Efficiency Practices

- **Lesson Content:**
    
    Using less energy is as important as producing clean energy! Switch off appliances when not in use, use LED bulbs, insulate homes, and choose energy-star appliances. Small steps add up to big savings!
    
- **Example:**
    
    LED bulbs use up to 75% less energy than traditional bulbs.

## Section 3: Future Energy Technologies

- **Lesson Content:**
    
    New advances include solar paint, ocean wave generators, and homes powered by rooftop wind turbines. Battery technology is rapidly improving, allowing us to store wind and solar energy even when the sun isn’t shining or the wind isn’t blowing.
    
- **Fun Fact:**
    
    Some buses in Europe run on hydrogen fuel cells, which only produce water as waste!

## Section 4: Why Renewable Energy Matters

- **Lesson Content:**
    
    Traditional energy sources like coal and oil pollute the air and contribute to climate change. Renewables are clean, safe, and never run out! More countries are investing in clean energy to protect our planet.
    
- **Example:**
    
    India is now among the leading countries in installing solar panels.
